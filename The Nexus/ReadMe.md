# The Nexus

## Use case
I made this sandbox in my home lab because my old windows computer gave out and stopped working.\
Because of that, I started running all my work on my ipad pro but I need windows so i decided to work on\
making a proxmox sandbox I can remote into and use anywhere I am using tailscale vpn connections.

## Outline ***(ongoing project & subject to change)***
- Proxmox server (The Nexus) for workstation and sandbox environment
  - windows11 VM (Oracle) for my main workstation
- Tailscale
  - used for connection to Oracle & Nexus from ipad
